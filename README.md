## Overview 
The app's main purpose of creation was our desire to have a decent way to schedule sport activities with friends. 

```Fitmit``` allows users, straight after registration, to create groups and customize them with description and profile picture. As an administrator
of the group you can add other members and all of you can set up events and pinpoint a location.

Our app includes interactive map provided by Google, that shows users all incoming events as pins and comes with a nice slider allowing users to swipe
between them.

On top of everything, user can edit his own profile, fill the description and highlight his main activites that he is interested in.
